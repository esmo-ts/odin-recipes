    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Mexican birria tacos, Jalisco-style, made with braised beef that's slow-cooked in<br> a fragrant 3-chile sauce with a delicious spice mix. Crispy tacos, and tender,<br> mouth-watering beef team up with melted Mexican cheese in this impressive<br> meal. This recipe takes a little time but it's so worth it!</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Dried chile peppers:</strong> The flavorful birria starts with dried guajillo chile<br> peppers, chile de arbol peppers, and ancho chiles. For a bit of extra heat,<br> don't remove all the seeds.</li>
        <li><strong>Beef:</strong> Beef chuck roast is perfect for braising for hours. When you're done,<br> the meat will shred incredibly easily.</li>
        <li><strong>Seasonings:</strong> You'll need salt, pepper, fresh garlic, whole cloves, cinnamon,<br> cumin, thyme, marjoram, and oregano.</li>
        <li><strong>Olive oil:</strong> Sear the meat in olive oil before you add the braising liquid.</li>
        <li><strong>Tomatoes:</strong> Grill Roma tomatoes before blending them with other<br> ingredients to unlock extra layers of flavor.</li>
        <li><strong>Vinegar:</strong> Two tablespoons of white vinegar adds even more acidity to the<br> braising liquid.</li>
        <li><strong>Tortillas:</strong> Use store-bought or homemade corn tortillas.</li>
        <li><strong>Onion</strong> and <strong>cilantro:</strong> Finish each taco with chopped onion and fresh cilantro<br> for a final punch of flavor and texture.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Boil the dried peppers for 5 minutes, then remove from heat and let the<br> peppers soak until the water is cool. Drain, reserving some water.</li>
        <li>Season the beef and sear on all sides in oil in a Dutch oven.</li>
        <li>Grill the tomatoes until the skin is blistered and begins to peel.</li>
        <li>Blend the soaked chili peppers with the reserved chile water, tomatoes,<br> vinegar, and seasonings.</li>
        <li>Strain the sauce and pour over the meat. Cover the Dutch oven and cook<br> until the meat begins to fall apart, basting often. Allow the meat to rest,<br> then shred.</li>
        <li>Warm the tortillas on the griddle. Fill each tortilla with meat, onions, and<br> cilantro.</li>
    </ol>
