    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>A chicken burger the whole family enjoys! Natasha is my eldest daughter, and<br> her eyes light up when I announce we're having these for dinner. The onion can<br> be finely chopped, but with three kids, we prefer grating it so as to hide it. I<br> usually serve these with mashed potatoes and Caesar salad for a very<br> comforting meal!</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Ground chicken:</strong> This recipe starts with a pound of extra-lean ground<br> chicken.</li>
        <li><strong>Bread crumbs:</strong> Use store-bought bread crumbs or make your own at home. </li>
        <li><strong>Onion:</strong> Half an onion lends texture and flavor.</li>
        <li><strong>Egg:</strong> An egg adds moisture and helps bind the chicken patties together.</li>
        <li><strong>Seasonings:</strong> These chicken burgers are seasoned with fresh garlic, salt, and<br> pepper. </li>
        <li><strong>Oil:</strong> Cook the chicken burger patties in olive oil on the stove.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
       <li>Mix the chicken, half of the crumbs, onion, egg, and seasonings in a bowl.</li>
       <li>Shape the mixture into oval-shaped patties.</li>
       <li>Coat the patties into the remaining bread crumbs.</li>
       <li>Cook the patties until they are deeply brown on both sides.</li>
    </ol>
